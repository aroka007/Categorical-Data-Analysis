*Project on Womens Choice of Contraceptives*. 
In this project, I am interested in finding out what type of contraceptive methods are frequently chosen by women of different demographics. This information is valuable to help discern what kind of women are using birth control as it could be used to create targeting marketing campaigns or help improve a products appeal to specific types of women allowing for an easier decision-making process. Please feel free to check out the report, code and presentation.
